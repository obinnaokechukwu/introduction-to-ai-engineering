# Chapter 7: Mastering the Google Gemini API

Having explored the APIs from OpenAI and Anthropic, we now turn our attention to the third major player in the AI landscape: Google. With its Gemini family of models, Google has built an API that is "multimodal native" from the ground up, designed to seamlessly handle a mix of text, images, audio, and video. This makes it an exceptionally powerful tool for building applications that need to understand the world in a more holistic way.

This chapter will serve as your comprehensive guide to the Google Generative AI Python SDK. We'll cover everything from making your first simple request to building sophisticated systems that can analyze video feeds and technical documents, giving you a complete understanding of how and when to leverage Google's powerful AI ecosystem.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

-   Make your first Gemini API call using the `google-generativeai` library.
-   Understand and leverage Gemini's native multimodal capabilities.
-   Process and analyze video, audio, and PDF content with Gemini models.
-   Implement function calling to connect Gemini to your own tools.
-   Build an industrial IoT predictive maintenance system that analyzes sensor data and technical diagrams.
-   Compare Gemini models and choose the optimal one for your use case.

## Your First Gemini API Call: Clean and Simple

Google's Python SDK is designed for simplicity. Let's start with the absolute basics.

### The Minimum Code

First, ensure you have the library installed and an API key from the Google AI Studio.

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

The simplest interaction with Gemini looks like this:

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

# Configure the library with your API key
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY")

# Create a GenerativeModel instance
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash') # Flash is fast and cost-effective

# Send a prompt to the model
response = model.generate_content("Hello, Gemini!")

# Print the text response
print(response.text)
```

Notice the straightforward, object-oriented approach: you instantiate a `GenerativeModel` and then call its `generate_content` method. This pattern will be consistent throughout our work with the API.

### A Reusable Function

Let's formalize this into a secure, reusable function.

```python
import google.generativeai as genai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load your API key securely from a .env file
load_dotenv()
genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))

def ask_gemini(prompt: str) -> str:
    """Sends a single prompt to Gemini and returns the text response."""
    try:
        model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
        response = model.generate_content(prompt)
        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred with the Gemini API: {e}"

# Let's test it
explanation = ask_gemini("In simple terms, what is multimodal AI?")
print(f"Gemini's Response: {explanation}")
```

## System Instructions: Guiding Gemini's Behavior

Like other models, Gemini can be guided by a high-level directive. In the Gemini API, this is called a `system_instruction`. It's a powerful way to set the model's persona, context, and constraints.

```python
def create_gemini_specialist(system_instruction: str, user_prompt: str) -> str:
    """Creates a specialized Gemini assistant using system instructions."""
    
    # Pass the system_instruction directly when creating the model
    model = genai.GenerativeModel(
        'gemini-1.5-pro', # Use the more powerful Pro model for complex instructions
        system_instruction=system_instruction
    )
    
    response = model.generate_content(user_prompt)
    return response.text

# Define a detailed persona for an industrial IoT engineer
iiot_expert_instruction = """
You are an expert Industrial IoT (IIoT) engineer specializing in predictive maintenance for heavy machinery. Your analysis should always consider:
- Safety implications first and foremost.
- The impact on production uptime.
- Cost-effectiveness of proposed solutions.
- The harsh operating environment (vibration, dust, temperature extremes).
Provide clear, actionable, and prioritized recommendations.
"""

user_problem = "Vibration sensors on our main conveyor motor are showing a 30% increase in amplitude over the past week. What should be our plan?"

# Get the expert diagnosis
diagnosis = create_gemini_specialist(iiot_expert_instruction, user_problem)
print(diagnosis)
```

Gemini's adherence to these instructions is excellent, making it a reliable choice for building specialized agents.

## Building Conversations with Chat History

To build a conversational application, you need to manage the chat history. The Gemini SDK provides a convenient `ChatSession` object for this.

```python
class GeminiChatbot:
    def __init__(self, system_instruction="You are a helpful assistant."):
        model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash', system_instruction=system_instruction)
        # The start_chat() method creates a stateful session
        self.chat_session = model.start_chat(history=[])

    def send(self, user_message: str) -> str:
        """Sends a message to the chat session and returns the response."""
        print(f"You: {user_message}")
        # The send_message method automatically appends both the user message
        # and the model's response to the session's history.
        response = self.chat_session.send_message(user_message)
        print(f"Gemini: {response.text}")
        return response.text

# Let's test the chatbot's memory
bot = GeminiChatbot("You are an IoT troubleshooting expert.")
bot.send("My smart thermostat is stuck at 15°C.")
bot.send("I've already tried restarting it. What should I check next?")
```

The `ChatSession` object handles the history management for you, making conversational applications incredibly easy to build.

## Unlocking Multimodal AI

This is where Gemini truly excels. Its API is designed to accept a list of different content types—text, images, audio, video—all within a single prompt.

### Analyzing Images

You can pass image data directly to `generate_content`.

```python
import PIL.Image

def analyze_iot_setup(image_path: str, prompt: str) -> str:
    """Analyzes an image of an IoT setup using Gemini."""
    try:
        img = PIL.Image.open(image_path)
        
        model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro')
        
        # The prompt is a list containing both text and image objects
        response = model.generate_content([prompt, img])
        return response.text
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Error: Image file not found. Please provide a valid path."

# You would need an image file named 'iot_panel.jpg' to run this.
# For example:
# prompt = "This is a photo of one of our IoT control panels. Identify any potential safety hazards or incorrect wiring."
# analysis = analyze_iot_setup('iot_panel.jpg', prompt)
# print(analysis)
```

### The Power of Video Analysis

Gemini's ability to process video opens up new frontiers for AI applications, from process monitoring to safety compliance. The SDK simplifies this by letting you upload a video file and then reference it in your prompt.

```python
import time

def analyze_industrial_video(video_path: str, prompt: str) -> str:
    """Uploads and analyzes a video file to identify operational issues."""
    
    print(f"Uploading video file: {video_path}...")
    # 1. Upload the file to Google's servers. This returns a file handle.
    video_file = genai.upload_file(path=video_path)
    
    # 2. Wait for the file to finish processing.
    while video_file.state.name == "PROCESSING":
        print("Waiting for video to process...")
        time.sleep(5)
        video_file = genai.get_file(name=video_file.name)
        
    if video_file.state.name == "FAILED":
        raise ValueError(f"Video processing failed: {video_file.state}")
        
    print("Video processed successfully!")

    # 3. Call the model with the prompt and the file handle.
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro')
    response = model.generate_content([prompt, video_file])
    
    # Optional: Delete the file after use to manage storage
    genai.delete_file(name=video_file.name)
    
    return response.text

# To test, you would need a video file, e.g., 'conveyor_belt.mp4'.
# prompt = "Analyze this video of a conveyor belt. Is the motion smooth? Are there any signs of mechanical stress or potential failure points? Note any specific timestamps of concern."
# video_analysis = analyze_industrial_video('conveyor_belt.mp4', prompt)
# print(video_analysis)
```

### Analyzing PDFs and Audio

The same `upload_file` pattern works for other complex file types like audio and PDFs, making Gemini a versatile tool for analyzing technical manuals, maintenance logs, and field reports.

```python
def summarize_pdf_manual(pdf_path: str) -> str:
    """Uploads a PDF and asks Gemini to summarize it."""
    
    print(f"Uploading PDF: {pdf_path}...")
    pdf_file = genai.upload_file(path=pdf_path)
    while pdf_file.state.name == "PROCESSING":
        print("Waiting for PDF to process...")
        time.sleep(2)
        pdf_file = genai.get_file(name=pdf_file.name)
        
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro')
    prompt = "Summarize this technical manual. Extract the key specifications, safety warnings, and the main troubleshooting steps."
    response = model.generate_content([prompt, pdf_file])
    
    return response.text

# To test, you would need a PDF file, e.g., 'sensor_manual.pdf'.
# summary = summarize_pdf_manual('sensor_manual.pdf')
# print(summary)
```

## Function Calling with Gemini

Gemini also supports function calling, allowing it to interact with your code. The Gemini SDK cleverly allows you to pass your Python functions directly as `tools`, and it handles the schema generation and execution automatically.

### Automatic Function Calling

Let's build a simple IoT toolkit.

```python
# Define our Python functions (our "tools")
def get_sensor_reading(sensor_id: str) -> dict:
    """Gets the current reading for a specific IoT sensor."""
    print(f"--- TOOL EXECUTED: get_sensor_reading for {sensor_id} ---")
    if "TEMP" in sensor_id:
        return {"value": 25.5, "unit": "°C"}
    elif "VIBR" in sensor_id:
        return {"value": 1.2, "unit": "g"}
    return {"error": "Sensor not found"}

def set_device_state(device_id: str, state: str) -> dict:
    """Sets the state of a device (e.g., 'on' or 'off')."""
    print(f"--- TOOL EXECUTED: set_device_state for {device_id} to {state} ---")
    return {"device_id": device_id, "status": "success", "new_state": state}

# Create a model and provide the functions as tools
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    tools=[get_sensor_reading, set_device_state]
)

# Start a chat session with automatic function calling enabled
chat = model.start_chat(enable_automatic_function_calling=True)

# Let's test it
response = chat.send_message("What is the current reading for sensor TEMP-01?")
print(f"Final Response: {response.text}")

response = chat.send_message("Please turn on the cooling fan FAN-01.")
print(f"Final Response: {response.text}")
```
The SDK handles the entire two-step function calling loop for you:
1.  It sends the prompt to Gemini.
2.  Gemini responds that it wants to call a function.
3.  The SDK intercepts this, calls your actual Python function with the correct arguments.
4.  It sends the function's return value back to Gemini.
5.  It receives Gemini's final, user-facing response and returns it to you.

This automated flow makes tool integration incredibly straightforward.

## Building a Predictive Maintenance System with Gemini

Let's combine these capabilities into a more comprehensive industrial application. We'll build a system that can analyze a technical diagram, look up live sensor data, and recommend maintenance actions.

```python
import PIL.Image

# Let's expand our toolkit for our predictive maintenance system
def get_maintenance_history(equipment_id: str) -> list:
    """Retrieves the maintenance history for a piece of equipment."""
    print(f"--- TOOL: Getting history for {equipment_id} ---")
    # Dummy data
    return [
        {"date": "2023-11-10", "action": "Replaced bearing"},
        {"date": "2024-03-22", "action": "Lubricated motor"}
    ]

# Create the advanced model
maintenance_model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-pro',
    tools=[get_sensor_reading, get_maintenance_history],
    system_instruction="You are a predictive maintenance expert for industrial machinery."
)

def predictive_maintenance_analysis(equipment_id: str, diagram_path: str):
    """Performs a full analysis using diagrams and live data."""
    try:
        diagram_image = PIL.Image.open(diagram_path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Error: Diagram image not found."
    
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze the provided technical diagram for equipment {equipment_id}.
    Then, using your available tools, get its current sensor readings for vibration
    and its past maintenance history.
    
    Based on all three pieces of information (diagram, live data, history),
    provide a predictive maintenance assessment and recommend specific actions.
    """
    
    # The SDK will automatically use the tools as needed to answer the prompt.
    chat = maintenance_model.start_chat(enable_automatic_function_calling=True)
    response = chat.send_message([prompt, diagram_image])
    
    return response.text

# To test, you would need an image file named 'motor_diagram.png'.
# report = predictive_maintenance_analysis("MOTOR-007", "motor_diagram.png")
# print(report)
```

This example showcases the power of Gemini's native multimodality. We can provide text instructions and a visual diagram in the same prompt, and the model can reason across both while also using tools to fetch live, relevant data to form its final recommendation.
