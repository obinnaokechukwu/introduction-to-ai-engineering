# Introduction to AI Engineering

Over the past few months, I have spoken with a few friends—all bright people, senior software engineers who wanted to learn about AI, but couldn't figure out where to begin. They were frustrated. They knew that the AI revolution is happening, but they felt completely lost. "Where do we even start?" one asked. "I'm drowning in a firehose of information. One blog tells me to learn linear algebra, another gives me a five-line 'Hello, AI' tutorial that's useless for my actual job."

They were stuck between two extremes: impenetrable academic papers on one side and trivial toy examples on the other. There was no clear, practical path for a working developer to learn how to build real, production-grade AI systems.

I decided to write the guide I wished I could give them. This book is that guide. I wrote it for them, and now, for you. It is a direct, hands-on journey designed to take you from zero knowledge to being a confident and capable AI engineer.

### This Book is Different

This is not a regular computer science textbook. It is a practical, opinionated guide for developers who need to build things that work.

You will **not** find dense chapters on backpropagation, transformer mathematics, or the intricacies of attention mechanisms. We will specifically avoid the deep learning theory that, while fascinating, is not necessary for building 99% of modern AI applications.

Instead, you will find battle-tested patterns for using the most powerful AI APIs available today: OpenAI's GPT series, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini. To make the concepts stick and the learning path coherent, we'll anchor our examples in a single, practical domain: the Internet of Things (IoT). From analyzing sensor data to orchestrating fleets of devices, these IoT examples provide a tangible and consistent backdrop for learning every core concept.

### What You'll Actually Learn

This book is about building. By the time you're finished, you will be able to:

-   **Build production systems** that can understand and generate text, images, audio, and even video.
-   **Design AI agents** that can use your own custom tools to interact with the world and collaborate to solve complex problems.
-   **Master prompt engineering**, moving from simple questions to sophisticated, multi-step reasoning frameworks.
-   **Architect and deploy AI applications** that are scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.
-   **Test and debug** probabilistic AI systems with confidence.

Every technique is demonstrated with Python code that you can run and experiment with immediately. Every pattern has been vetted in real-world production environments.

### A Note on the Tools Used

It is only fitting that a book about applied AI was itself created with the help of AI. Large portions of the prose and code examples in this guide were written, edited, and refined in collaboration with advanced AI models, specifically **Claude 4** and **Gemini 2.5**. I used them as a tireless editor, a brainstorming partner, a code reviewer, and a synthesizer of complex ideas. This book is a testament to the power of human-AI collaboration—the very skill it aims to teach.

### On a Fast-Moving Field

The AI landscape moves at a dizzying pace. The model you use today might be superseded in six months. A new API might change its syntax. This can feel daunting, but it's why this book focuses on what lasts.

While specific API endpoints or model names will undoubtedly change, the fundamental principles of interacting with large language models are remarkably durable. The concepts of prompt engineering, managing context windows, designing agentic workflows, and ensuring system safety are the essential mechanics of this new field. The tools will evolve, but the foundation you build here will remain relevant. Think of it like learning to drive: the make and model of the car will change, but the principles of steering, accelerating, braking, and navigating traffic are timeless.

This is a book about the essentials. It is designed to give you a foundation that will hopefully be applicable for years to come.

The best way to learn is by building. Let's get started.
