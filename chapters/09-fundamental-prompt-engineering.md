# Chapter 9: Fundamental Prompt Engineering

In previous chapters, we learned how to make API calls to AI models. Now, we will learn the art and science of **prompt engineering**â€”the skill of crafting inputs that guide an AI to produce the exact output you desire. A well-engineered prompt is the difference between a generic, unhelpful response and a precise, actionable, and reliable one.

Think of an LLM as an incredibly talented but unguided intern. A vague request like "write about our product" will yield a generic essay. A specific prompt like "Write a three-paragraph marketing description for our new IoT temperature sensor, targeting industrial facility managers, focusing on its five-year battery life and durability, and end with a call to action to request a demo" will yield a powerful piece of marketing copy. This chapter is about learning how to give those perfect instructions.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

-   Write prompts that consistently produce high-quality, structured results.
-   Master the core prompting patterns: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought.
-   Use role-based prompting to get expert-level analysis for different domains.
-   Control AI behavior with `temperature` and other parameters for optimal results.
-   A/B test different prompt versions to find the most effective one.
-   Build a smart IoT device diagnostic system using advanced prompting techniques.

## From Vague to Valuable: The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

The most common mistake in prompt engineering is vagueness. Let's see the difference.

### The Bad Prompt

A vague prompt lacks detail and context, forcing the AI to guess what you want.

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI()

# A bad prompt: vague, unclear, and without direction.
bad_prompt = "Tell me about our IoT device."

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": bad_prompt}]
)

# The result will be a generic, unhelpful summary.
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### The Good Prompt

An effective prompt is specific, providing the AI with all the necessary ingredients to produce a high-quality response.

```python
# A good prompt: specific, contextual, and structured.
good_prompt = """
Analyze the following IoT device log and classify its status.

**Device Log:**
"2024-07-10 14:32:15 - TEMP-007 - Battery: 12% - Signal: Weak - Status: Active"

**Instructions:**
1.  **Task:** Classify the device's overall health as 'Healthy', 'Warning', or 'Critical'.
2.  **Format:** Respond with a JSON object containing 'device_id', 'health_status', and 'reason'.
3.  **Context:** A battery level below 20% is a 'Warning'. A 'Weak' signal is also a 'Warning'.
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": good_prompt}]
)

# The result will be a precise, structured, and actionable JSON object.
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### The Five Elements of an Effective Prompt

Every great prompt should contain some or all of these five elements:

1.  **Task:** A clear and specific verb describing what you want the AI to do (e.g., "Summarize," "Translate," "Classify," "Generate code").
2.  **Context:** Background information the AI needs to complete the task successfully (e.g., the user's role, the source of the data, business rules).
3.  **Format:** The desired structure of the output (e.g., "JSON," "a bulleted list," "a three-paragraph summary").
4.  **Examples (Few-Shot):** One or more examples of the desired input/output format. This is one of the most powerful ways to guide the AI.
5.  **Role (Persona):** A persona for the AI to adopt (e.g., "You are an expert cybersecurity analyst," "You are a friendly customer service agent").

## Pattern 1: Zero-Shot Prompting (Just Ask)

**Zero-shot prompting** is the simplest form: you ask the AI to perform a task without giving it any prior examples. This works surprisingly well for general knowledge and common tasks that the model has seen many times in its training data.

```python
def zero_shot_analysis(log_entry: str) -> str:
    """Analyzes a log entry using a simple zero-shot prompt."""
    
    prompt = f"""
Analyze this IoT log entry and provide a one-sentence summary of the key issue.

Log Entry: "{log_entry}"

Summary:
"""
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

log = "2024-07-10 15:00:05 - PUMP-03 - Pressure reading of 250 PSI exceeds maximum threshold of 200 PSI."
print(zero_shot_analysis(log))
```

**When to use it:** For simple, well-defined tasks where the AI likely has extensive training data (e.g., summarization, simple classification, general questions).

## Pattern 2: Few-Shot Prompting (Show, Don't Just Tell)

**Few-shot prompting** is one of the most effective techniques for improving the accuracy and consistency of AI responses. Instead of just describing what you want, you provide a few examples of inputs and their corresponding desired outputs. This teaches the AI the exact pattern and format you expect.

```python
def few_shot_classifier(alert_text: str) -> str:
    """Classifies IoT alerts into predefined categories using examples."""
    
    prompt = f"""
Classify the following IoT alert into one of these categories: [Connectivity, Power, Sensor_Failure, Security].

---
Example 1:
Alert: "Device TEMP-01 failed to check in."
Category: Connectivity

Example 2:
Alert: "Device DOOR-05 battery level at 4%."
Category: Power

Example 3:
Alert: "Device CAM-02 reported anomalous reading outside of normal range."
Category: Sensor_Failure

Example 4:
Alert: "Multiple failed login attempts detected for GATEWAY-01."
Category: Security
---

Now, classify this alert:
Alert: "{alert_text}"
Category:
"""

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.0 # Use low temperature for classification tasks
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

print(f"Classification: {few_shot_classifier('Sensor HUMID-07 reporting negative humidity values.')}")
print(f"Classification: {few_shot_classifier('Device LIGHT-10 lost connection to WiFi network.')}")
```

**When to use it:** When you need a specific output format, when the task is novel, or when you need to improve the consistency and reliability of the output.

## Pattern 3: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

LLMs often make mistakes in complex reasoning because they try to generate the answer in one step. **Chain-of-thought prompting** is a simple but powerful technique that forces the model to "think out loud" by breaking the problem down into intermediate steps. Simply adding the phrase "Let's think step by step" can dramatically improve performance on logic puzzles, math problems, and multi-step reasoning tasks.

```python
def chain_of_thought_diagnosis(symptoms: str) -> str:
    """Diagnoses a complex IoT issue using chain-of-thought reasoning."""
    
    prompt = f"""
An IoT device is exhibiting the following symptoms:
{symptoms}

Let's think step by step to diagnose the root cause.
1. First, analyze each symptom individually.
2. Then, look for connections or correlations between the symptoms.
3. Based on the connections, formulate the most likely hypotheses for the root cause.
4. Finally, suggest a diagnostic action to confirm the most likely hypothesis.
"""
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.3
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

symptom_list = """
- Temperature readings are fluctuating wildly.
- Battery level is draining much faster than usual.
- The device disconnects from the network intermittently.
"""

print(chain_of_thought_diagnosis(symptom_list))
```
By forcing the model to articulate its reasoning process, it's more likely to follow a logical path and arrive at a correct conclusion. It also makes the AI's reasoning transparent and easier for a human to debug.

## Pattern 4: Role-Based Prompting (The Persona Pattern)

Instructing the AI to adopt a specific **role** or **persona** is a highly effective way to tailor its response style, tone, and content. When you tell the AI to "act as an expert cybersecurity analyst," you are priming it to access the patterns and vocabulary associated with that role from its training data.

```python
def get_expert_analysis(problem_description: str, expert_role: str) -> str:
    """Gets an analysis of a problem from a specific expert's perspective."""
    
    prompt = f"""
You are a world-class {expert_role}.
Analyze the following situation from your specific professional viewpoint.

Situation: A fleet of 500 IoT delivery drones is experiencing a 15% failure rate in their GPS modules.

Provide your expert analysis, focusing on the key issues, risks, and recommended actions relevant to your role.
"""
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Get analyses from multiple different experts on the same problem
roles_to_consult = [
    "Hardware Engineer specializing in GPS modules",
    "Network Engineer focused on data transmission",
    "Logistics and Operations Manager",
    "Cybersecurity Analyst concerned with signal spoofing"
]

for role in roles_to_consult:
    print(f"--- Analysis from a {role} ---")
    print(get_expert_analysis("Drone GPS failures", role))
    print("\n")
```

This technique is incredibly powerful for tackling a problem from multiple angles, revealing insights that a single, generic prompt might miss.

## A/B Testing Prompts for Optimal Performance

Your first prompt is rarely your best one. Production-grade AI applications require testing and iteration. A/B testingâ€”or more accurately, A/B/C/n testingâ€”is the process of comparing multiple prompt variants against a set of test cases to see which one performs best.

```python
import time

class PromptTester:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = openai.OpenAI()

    def test_prompt_variants(self, test_input: str, prompt_variants: list[str]) -> dict:
        """Tests multiple prompt variants for a single input."""
        results = {}
        for i, prompt_template in enumerate(prompt_variants):
            variant_name = f"Variant-{i+1}"
            
            # Fill the template with the test input
            full_prompt = prompt_template.format(input=test_input)
            
            response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o-mini",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": full_prompt}]
            ).choices[0].message.content
            
            results[variant_name] = response
            time.sleep(1) # Simple rate limiting for the test
        return results

# Let's test different ways to ask for a JSON summary of an alert.
alert_text = "Device PUMP-01 reports pressure at 300 PSI. The safe limit is 250 PSI."

variants = [
    # Variant 1: Simple and direct
    "Summarize this alert in JSON: {input}",
    
    # Variant 2: More specific about keys
    "Extract the device_id, metric, value, and limit from this alert into a JSON object: {input}",
    
    # Variant 3: Few-shot example
    """
Convert the alert into a structured JSON object.
Example: 'Device TEMP-01 at 50C' -> {{"device_id": "TEMP-01", "metric": "temperature", "value": 50}}
Alert to convert: {input}
"""
]

tester = PromptTester()
test_results = tester.test_prompt_variants(alert_text, variants)

for variant, result in test_results.items():
    print(f"--- {variant} ---")
    print(result)
```
By running several test cases through this framework, you can quantitatively and qualitatively determine which prompt structure yields the most reliable results for your application.

## Putting It All Together: A Smart IoT Diagnostic System

Let's build a complete diagnostic system that uses all the patterns we've learned to provide a comprehensive analysis of an IoT device alert.

```python
from typing import Dict

class IoTDiagnosticSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = openai.OpenAI()

    def generate_report(self, alert_log: str, device_context: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Generates a complete diagnostic report for an IoT alert."""
        
        # 1. Classify the alert using a Few-Shot Prompt
        classification_prompt = f"""
Classify this alert log into one of [Power, Connectivity, Sensor_Failure, Software_Bug].
Example 1: "Battery at 3%" -> Power
Example 2: "Failed to connect to WiFi" -> Connectivity
Log: "{alert_log}"
Category:
"""
        category = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": classification_prompt}]
        ).choices[0].message.content

        # 2. Get a detailed diagnosis using Chain-of-Thought
        diagnosis_prompt = f"""
An IoT device reported the following alert: "{alert_log}".
Device context: {device_context}

Let's diagnose this step by step:
1.  What is the immediate problem indicated by the alert?
2.  Considering the device context, what are the 2-3 most likely root causes?
3.  What is the recommended first action to take to verify the cause?
"""
        diagnosis = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.3,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": diagnosis_prompt}]
        ).choices[0].message.content

        # 3. Get a specialized opinion using Role-Based Prompting
        security_prompt = f"""
You are a cybersecurity expert. Analyze this IoT alert for potential security implications:
Alert: "{alert_log}"
Context: {device_context}
"""
        security_analysis = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.2,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": security_prompt}]
        ).choices[0].message.content

        # 4. Assemble the final report
        report = {
            "alert": alert_log,
            "category": category,
            "diagnosis_reasoning": diagnosis,
            "security_assessment": security_analysis,
            "report_generated_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
        return report

# --- Demo of the complete system ---
system = IoTDiagnosticSystem()

test_alert = "Device MOTION-07 is spamming the server with thousands of 'motion detected' events per second."
test_context = {
    "device_type": "PIR Motion Sensor",
    "firmware_version": "v1.2.1",
    "last_firmware_update": "2024-06-01",
    "location": "Main entrance"
}

full_report = system.generate_report(test_alert, test_context)

print(json.dumps(full_report, indent=2))
```

This final example demonstrates how these fundamental prompting patterns are not used in isolation but are combined to build a sophisticated, multi-faceted analysis workflow.

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering is the new essential skill for developers in the age of AI. It is a craft that blends clear instructions, contextual awareness, and structured thinking. By mastering the patterns in this chapterâ€”zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and role-based promptingâ€”you have gained the ability to command AI models with precision and predictability.

Remember the core principle: **garbage in, garbage out.** A vague prompt will always yield a vague response. A specific, well-structured, and context-rich prompt is the key to unlocking the full potential of any LLM. Always test, iterate, and refine your prompts as you would any other piece of code. You are now equipped to build more reliable, accurate, and powerful AI features.
